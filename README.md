# PythonFunkin
Friday Night Funkin', but recreated in Python language.
This serves as my first ever Python project, and mostly uses the Pygame 2.0 library.
It is also currently not fully complete - expect bug fixes and new features in the near future.
## Features
- The original game recreated using our own scoring system. (It currently really is only able to play songs at 100 BPM).
- Importing your own OGG and JSON files to be able to play your own songs & charts!
- A much better version of the Friday Night Funkin' editor that lets you create your own charts. (Not much done yet, though.)
- Cross-compability -- It should be able to run both on Visual Studio Code using Pygame and on the iOS app Pythonista. (To build the game on Pythonista, see iOS_Build.md)
